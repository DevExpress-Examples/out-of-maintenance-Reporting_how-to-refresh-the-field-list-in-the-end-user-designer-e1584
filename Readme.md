# How to refresh the Field List in the End-User Designer


<p>This example demonstrates how to programmatically update the Field List in the End-User Designer. This may be required when a data source is created and bound to a report at runtime, and isn't present in the designer host of the End-User Designer. For instance, this situation occurs when a data source is represented by a list (e.g. <strong>ArrayList</strong>), as demonstrated in the sample below.</p><p>To accomplish this task, we've introduced the <strong>FieldListDockPanel.UpdateDataSource</strong> method, which should be called after assigning a data source to a report.</p>
